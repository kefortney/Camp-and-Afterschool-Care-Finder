All kids who come to Bread & Butter for ANY week will learn about the farm, our philosophy of land, plant, and animal management, and our reverence for the land that sustains us all. FIT week offers kids the opportunity to dig into life on our farm, taking on new roles and responsibilities. They'll learn about soil health and growing food, caring for animals by allowing them to be as wild as possible, the interaction between our farm animals and the wilderness, our farm store and how we sell our food to our community. The kids are truly immersed into day-to-day life on the farm and engage with the people/farmers and the plants and animals alike!

https://www.ontastudio.com/camps,Onta Studio - Ninja Science Camp,Camp #3,"This camp combines all the martial arts, tumbling, and parkour that your kids love, with environmental science and art education! This year we are switching up our science curriculum to a new, more hands on, STEAM based, curriculum. Each of our assistant instructors this year are going to be heading up specific art projects, such as plant impressions in clay, beading animals, and even building volcanoes! We are very excited about it, which is why we have changed the name of our camps this year to Ninja STEAM Camps to reflect our new, more hands-on blending of arts and science based learning. We'll be doing lots of technique oriented Karate and Jiu-Jitsu, playing martial arts games, breaking boards, sword fighting, and delving deeper into meditation and the moral and ethical precepts of the martial arts. We'll also be talking about ants, space, and animal tracking! And we'll delve into ONTA's very own (kid friendly) Kung Fu movie library!",5,15,K,9,8/3/2026,8/7/2026,09:00 AM,03:00 PM,,,,373 Blair Park Road,Williston,
